# Dryboxes
I print in my garage in the UK and it's always too damp even for PLA. Current solution is OK but it's far from watertight.

They seem to be split into a number of approaches:
1. Fully printed single reel boxes
2. Large plastic box/RUB with port holding multiples
3. Cereal box single box prints

Having tried a big box I think I want a single roll approach

# What do I want?
MUST
1. Space for humidity sensor
1. Port for filament
1. Silica box
3. Sealed well to keep it dry for longer
1. Single roll per box - easier to change/add to

SHOULD
1. Easy to change silica
1. Easy to change filament

## Options
